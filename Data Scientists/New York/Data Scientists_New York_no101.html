      <p>
       If European privacy laws apply to you, our processing of personal information for the purposes mentioned above is based on the following legal grounds:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        As necessary to evaluate and potentially enter into an employment relationship with you;
       </li>
       <li>
        With your consent, which you may withdraw at any time;
       </li>
       <li>
        To comply with our legal obligations;
       </li>
       <li>
        Where necessary to protect your vital interests or those of others; and
       </li>
       <li>
        For our (or others') legitimate interests, including our interests in considering candidates for current and future employment opportunities and in managing and improving our recruitment and hiring process, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify the relevant individual and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Where the collection or processing of personal information is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the global nature of our business, Glossier may transfer your personal information across international borders, consistent with applicable data protection laws, including to the U.S., Canada and European Economic Area ("EEA"). Where personal information is transferred within Glossier to countries outside of the EEA that are not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection under European privacy laws, we do so through a series of intercompany agreements that implement the Standard Contractual Clauses authorized under European privacy laws. We also use a variety of safeguards to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected when processed by our third-party service providers operating in the U.S. or another country outside of the EEA including by signing EU standard contractual clauses or verifying the recipient adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. You may request additional information concerning such safeguards from the Privacy team by contacting privacy@glossier.com.
