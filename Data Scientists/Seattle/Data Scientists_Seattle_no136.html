       Data is at the core of Outreach's strategy. It drives ourselves and our customers to the highest levels of success. We use it for everything from customer health scores and revenue dashboards, to operational metrics of our AWS infrastructure, to helping increase product engagement and user productivity through natural language understanding, to predictive analytics and causal inference via experimentation. As our customer base continues to grow, we are looking towards new ways of leveraging our data to deeper understand our customers’ needs and deliver new products and features to help continuously improve their customer engagement workflows.
      </div>
      <div>
      </div>
      <div>
       <br/>
       The mission of the Data Science team is to enable such continuous optimization by reconstructing customer engagement workflows from data, developing metrics to measure success and efficiency of these workflows, and providing tools to support optimization of these workflows. As a member of the team, you will be on the ground floor working with Data Scientists - Inference and Algorithms, Machine Learning Engineers, Application Engineers, and other Data Scientists - Product Analytics, to define and implement our strategy for delivering on this mission.

          Outreach is a communication platform built from the ground up to help people communicate with customers more effectively. Today we focus on the sales organization, helping them engage with their prospects and customers through email, calling, and LinkedIn communication flows. Our customers spend the majority of their day living inside our software, relying on it to be more effective communicators with their audience.

         <div>
         </div>
         <li>
          <br/>
          Since our first days here at Outreach learning about how people communicate, we became obsessed with understanding our customers’ problems. As a result, we’ve built the most loved product on the market and won the hearts and minds (and business) of some incredible organizations around the world.

         <div>
         </div>
         <li>

          In addition to our relentless focus on the customer, we’ve received over $28039 million in venture funding, been listed on Seattle Business Magazine’s 100 Best Places to Work, been ranked #1 for 2016 Sales Automation/Acceleration software by Ambition and Apptus, and were named to the 2016 Forbes Cloud 100-Rising Star list in the Sales Technology Category. LinkedIn ranked Outreach as the #15 in theirLinkedIn’s Top 25 Startups List for 2018. CB Insights and The New York Times include Outreach as the50 Future Unicorns in 2018.
