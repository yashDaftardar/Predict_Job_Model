       We take privacy seriously.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The ideal candidate for this position cares deeply about the experience and satisfaction of our data partners, customers, and customers' customers. The verification platform we have built puts user consent at the core of our user interaction. SheerID uses a very minimal set of personal information to perform verifications and we never keep personally identifiable information. We never ask users to create a login/password on our system. We never share, sell, or remarket any personal information, ever. We provide strong privacy protections for consumers (as opposed to standard marketing techniques) and are poised to ride the wave of this major trend that started with GDPR and continues with the California Consumer Privacy Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      And our customers love us for it. Our Net Promoter Score is 70, which is a testament to the value we create and how highly the company values our customers and end users. We provide a frictionless experience and high-quality results for millions of verifications every month, attracting new customers, and building loyalty and longevity in every customer relationship.
     </p>
     <p>
      We sell our product to marketers and big brands, but serve the end consumer equally, making it easier for deserving populations (Students, Teachers, Nurses, Seniors, Military members, First Responders, etc) to access special offers in a way that protects their data privacy.
