      Review begins: April 9, 2021
     </p>
     <p>
      The National Library of Medicine (NLM), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is recruiting for a tenure-track or tenure-eligible investigator within its Intramural Research Program (IRP) in Bethesda, MD. The recruitment is part of a planned expansion of NLM’s intramural research in computational health sciences. The goal of the search is to extend and strengthen NLM research activities in the domain of clinical data science, which aims to develop novel approaches, methods, and best practices for drawing research inferences from large observational healthcare databases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Existing observational data from electronic medical records and health insurance claims are becoming increasingly available and can support clinical research in many ways including: determining the numbers and characteristics of potential study candidates; delivering outcomes for large pragmatic trials; providing the basis for observational studies; and finding outliers whose biology could stimulate research into novel therapies.
     </p>
     <p>
      The scientist’s focus will be in methods for analyzing large observational healthcare databases, including data from health insurance claims and electronic medical records. They will conduct research using innovative statistical and machine learning techniques applied to clinical data for developing novel solutions in support of knowledge discovery. Additionally, they will develop best practices for the use of large observational healthcare databases, including aspects related to data quality, inherent bias, and patient privacy. They will also seek to develop advanced clinical data science methods for biomedical research in partnership with clinically-oriented research groups at NIH and other organizations.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are looking for individuals with experience in clinical data science, computational health science, biomedical informatics, and clinical practice (optionally); recognized as an expert in these areas; with exemplary skills in and innovative approaches to the latest technologies; and demonstrated track record, including peer-reviewed publications. We encourage applications from individuals who have experience working with complex biomedical and health-related data and have the expertise to direct research projects that will result in generalizable, scalable, and reusable methodologies.
     </p>
     <p>
      The successful candidate with high-quality interpersonal skills will join a diverse, collegial, and cooperative group of investigators within NLM that provides the opportunity for high-quality mentoring. The selected candidate will be supported with long-term, stable resources equivalent to those provided to tenure-track faculty in an academic department, including positions for postdoctoral fellows and a budget for software, consumables, and equipment. NLM will provide excellent computational facilities and support for the rapid achievement of research goals. The broader NIH campus and NLM’s IRP provide a rich and highly interactive computational biology and biomedical informatics environment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applicants must have an M.D., Ph.D., M.D./Ph.D., or equivalent doctoral degree in a relevant field with extensive postdoctoral experience, as well as a strong publication record demonstrating potential for creative research.
     </p>
     <p>
      Continued clinical experience, including an appointment with the NIH Clinical Center, is a possibility if the candidate wishes to maintain their clinical skills
     </p>
     <p>
      The incumbent will enter into an ecosystem of currently available clinical/claims databases and could also forge pathways to new data sources such as a specific institutional medical record system, commercial medical record database, All of Us Research Program, National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), NIH Clinical Center’s BTRIS, dbGaP, OHDSI, the UK BioBank, the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and others.
     </p>
     <p>
      To support large-scale data analyses, the incumbent may also leverage state-of-the-art, high-performance computing resources such as NIH’s supercomputer Biowulf and innovative cloud environments such as the NIH Science and Technology Research Infrastructure for Discovery, Experimentation, and Sustainability (STRIDES) Initiative to streamline data processing, storage and analyses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Minimum Qualifications:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       MD, PhD, or MD/PhD or equivalent degree(s) in biomedical informatics or related discipline
      </li>
      <li>
       Experience with clinical practice, the data it generates, and important clinical questions
      </li>
      <li>
       Produce a well-articulated, innovative research agenda and have demonstrated track record, including peer-reviewed publications, of analyzing large clinical/claims data sets
      </li>
      <li>
       Experience with exploratory and statistical data analyses, such as, linear models, multivariate analysis, predictive modeling, and stochastic models
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Desired Qualifications:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Expertise in statistical data analysis, modeling, and machine learning
      </li>
      <li>
       Demonstrated ability to design and implement novel algorithms and methods
      </li>
      <li>
       Familiarity with standard structures and coding systems used to generate large clinical databases
      </li>
      <li>
       Experience with biological datasets tied to medical record data
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Salary and benefits are competitive, commensurate with education and experience. This position is subject to a background investigation.
     </p>
