     <p>
      The services that Elsevier provides are becoming increasingly dependent on Smart Content to support Elsevierâ€™s corporate strategy of greater volume, types and sophistication of content. Elsevier is looking for an intern Data Scientist with a focus on Machine Learning, NLP, and Statistical techniques to help build state of the art applications for the health sciences domain. Hands on coding of NLP/ML/statistical algorithms is an absolute must.
     </p>
     <p>
      This person will participate in the design, prototyping and implementation of TDM/ML and automation applications for our businesses. These applications have two main goals: cost savings by building workflow efficiencies or revenue generation by working directly on products or product capabilities. You will work closely with both the nursing education and health sciences teams. Sample projects may include extracting medical information from electronic health care records, recommender systems for adaptive nursing and education, integrating big data sets to perform predictive analytics, classifying and curating our image assets, content enrichment pipelines for clinical decision support and search algorithms.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will also work closely with the EMMeT (Elsevier Medical Merged Taxonomy) team providing data analytics on EMMeT and related terminologies to support decision-making, designing automated approaches to bulk updates, ontology validation and terminology mappings, and will bring ML/NLP expertise to the team. You will work with a team of medical experts, as well as product leads to determine how to best build and leverage semantic capabilities. Knowledge of database query language (SQL) and scripting language (Python) are mandatory. Experience with Natural Language Processing application is necessary, and experience with medical terminologies such as UMLS, SNOMED CT, ICD-9, ICD-10, CPT, LOINC etc is a plus.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will also work closely with NHE (Nursing and Health Education) and HESI where you will be involved in predictive and descriptive exploratory data analysis to support business decision making on these teams. Intuitions on how to work with ragged data and time series is appreciated. The ability to quickly perform exploratory data analysis, visualize your findings and make recommendations for further analysis that might provide valuable insights.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Main Activities and Responsibilities
     </p>
     <p>
      Text and data mining
     </p>
     <p>
      Bring active experience in to the organization on extraction text and data information from structured and unstructured data. Applying and developing these techniques, you will drive the implementation of automated annotation processes. Also well-versed in machine learning, you will bring new processes into the organization in order to improve (in cost and time-efficiency) the data excerption processes in Elsevier. This work includes the application of Elsevier's taxonomy and ontology assets to a wide variety of content - as well as drive developments in the application of and expansion on these vocabularies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Data analytics to support businesses and products
     </p>
     <p>
      Analyze extracted information to drive such processes as automated and manual data cleansing. Data analytics can also be used to identify research trends, drive decision for content acquisition, or merging big data sets to perform predictive analytics. Using visualizations tools to present the extracted data to be ready for consumption will be another key ability.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Contribute to process and product innovation
     </p>
     <p>
      The Data Science intern is also part of the wider team Content Transformation and Analytics team. Contributing to a culture of product and process innovation, this person will be a trusted resource in new development projects in Elsevier. The person will connect with IT developers and (content) subject matters experts, translating information needs into software development. As a specialist member of the team, the data scientist will serve as a specialist in his/her own field.
     </p>
     <p>
      Proving and showcasing methodology
     </p>
     <p>
      This person will prove the utility of new methods in a scientifically sound way. To show the value of new types of extraction and techniques, visualization and presentation of the value of the extracted data will be another key ability.

     </p>
     <p>
      Familiarity with supervised and unsupervised learning; model building, validation, and testing using state of art ML algorithms such as random forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Bayesian modeling
     </p>
     <p>
      Familiarity with taxonomy applications across scientific and healthcare disciplines is a plus
