        Overview
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass General Brigham’s board and system-wide executive leadership are making significant investments in enterprise data and digital health, enabling innovation and transformation in the delivery of health care, research and discovery. By building out core digital and data capabilities, we are supporting the achievement of Mass General Brigham’s mission to drive growth and innovation in inpatient, ambulatory, and digital care. We are at the start of this journey and we are looking for talented individuals from across the nation to join us in transforming healthcare and in achieving the expected outcomes of this strategy: improved patient care, quality of care, patient engagement, and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare with excellence.
      </p>

      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the achievement of these goals, Mass General Brigham’s data and analytic teams are working together to build a system-wide data ecosystem. We are both leveraging current assets and building new, integrated solutions to provide a holistic set of industry-leading data and analytic capabilities, supporting Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and real-time insights. Teams from Data and Analytics, Research Analytics, Clinical Data Science, and Information Systems are collaborating to build this new data and analytic ecosystem. To ensure success of this effort, Mass General Brigham is standing up a new Data and Analytics operating model with a goal of driving a level of standardization for data and analytic operations across the teams involved.

      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of investments in data and analytics were proven out during our response to COVID-19 as these investments were leveraged to stand up new reporting and analytic capabilities to support executive and clinical leadership on managing the pandemic. Our broad data and analytic community has come together across Mass General Brigham ’s 14 healthcare sites with shared urgency, delivering analytic tools to our system that drove timely insights in both clinical and operational domains, resulting in effective delivery of critical care and in organizational efficiencies during a time of reduced resources.
