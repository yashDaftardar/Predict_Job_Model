      <b>
       We are hiring a Senior Data Analyst in our Research Group!
      </b>
      <b>
       We are seeking someone with 2-5 years of experience in the research field.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Senior analysts are data-loving individuals with a desire to uncover trends and solve problems using their analytical skills. As a senior analyst, you will be responsible for the data collection, data analysis, and report generation portion of your projects. You will work directly with Fortune 500 companies across a variety of industries. Strong organizational skills are essential to keep your numerous monthly and quarterly data programs running simultaneously and on track. You will serve as the main point of contact for your client and their member companies involved in the data program, which will help you gain an understanding of your client’s data-driven needs. This position is a great opportunity to learn about consulting work in a wide variety of industries, managing data, and producing actionable reports while overseeing staff and coordinating efforts with our internal software development team.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       This is an opportunity to learn and grow with an inclusive and supportive organization.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Vault Consulting provides top quality outsourced accounting and full-service research programs to associations, nonprofits and the for-profit market and at Vault, core values are not just to splash on a website! We strive to find folks that not only believe in what we do but stand by our values of
      <b>
       Flexibility, Accountability, Collaboration, Appreciation
      </b>
      and
      <b>
       Drive for Excellence!
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      At the top of the organization is the CEO, the COO and the managing directors for each department. Directors and Managers report directly to the managing director of their department and have clients assigned to them. They are the engagement lead for that contract. Depending on client needs, a client team can have anywhere from 2-6+ team members. Each level is responsible, to some extent, for supervising and being available to the level below them. A senior analyst will get to work with and learn from managers and directors at Vault from the start.
     </p>
     <p>
      Additionally, each employee is matched with a mentor upon being hired. Their mentor is their go-to for any general questions and career guidance. The structure means that there are multiple people to ask a question to. And if one person doesn’t know the answer, there is a clear line of people to ask to escalate the question.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       The Skillset
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      A senior analyst typically has 2-5 years of experience in a research or analytical position, with a bachelor’s degree in economics, finance, statistics, or other business-related field. Coursework or experience in data science and computer science is a plus.
     </p>
     <p>
      You should come in with an eagerness to learn and grow in the research profession, with passion, a commitment to excellence, and the ability and desire to work in a fast-paced environment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The senior analyst skillset includes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Experience working directly with clients
      </li>
      <li>
       Experience leading internal teams and projects
      </li>
      <li>
       A track record of hitting deliverable timelines and working in a fast-paced environment
      </li>
      <li>
       Advanced Excel skills (vlookup, pivot tables, macros)
      </li>
      <li>
       Familiarity with Qualtrics or similar surveying software is a plus
      </li>
      <li>
       Interest or experience in relational databases or programming (especially Python) is a plus
      </li>
      <li>
       Interest or experience in with business intelligence platforms such as PowerBI, Tableau or Qlik is a plus
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <b>
       Within one month, you will:
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      As mentioned above, before you start at Vault you will be paired with a mentor, who will help guide you through your orientation, help design your first 30-day schedule and continue to be your go-to for your goals and regular check-ins. After an extensive onboarding program, you begin working on projects right away. You will also begin to take classes in “VaultU” from Day 1 of onboarding. Our internally developed training program ensures that all our staff members get the skill set they need to excel in their careers. Your first 30 days are all about learning about Vault, getting to know Vault’s staff, and becoming familiar with your projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Within three months, you will:
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      At the three-month mark, you will be the lead analyst on about 5 projects, which means you will now be one of the main points of contact for your association client and their member companies. You will be getting more familiar with our data collection and reporting processes and be becoming proficient while using our research applications (such as Excel or Qualtrics). Your client portfolio will continue to grow as your skillset is rounded out and you become more efficient in your tasks. The hours of work you spend on each project can vary. Some projects may require a few hours of work whereas other require a few days. You will learn how to best manage your time as you switch between all your projects. You will still have regular check ins with your mentor, who will continue to make sure you are settling into Vault life well and are staying on track with your goals. You will continue to take VaultU classes and complete individual training to further develop your skill sets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Within a year, you will:
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      By the end of year one, you will be fully integrated into Vault. You will have developed deeper relationships with Vault staff as well as your clients and their member companies. You will have about 10 clients that you regularly produce monthly and quarterly reports for. At this point, you may have designed a couple surveys, created new report visualizations, built new databases, and maybe you’re even thinking of taking on an interactive reporting project in Qlik. You will continue to learn at VaultU and start to develop a lunch and learn or VaultU course of your own. You will continue to have a close relationship with your mentor and may even have a mentee of your own. You will be streamlining your projects for efficiency and brainstorming about the skills or software you would like to learn in the next year. We want you to be promoted within two years of beginning your career at Vault.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Other Interesting Information:
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Why do you like working at Vault? The amount of support you get at Vault cannot be beaten. From orientation, which last 4 days to make sure you have all the information you need to get you started, to the mentorship program, to the open-door policy everyone has, you are never without someone to help you with a question or problem. Between all our team members in the research group, there is usually someone who has seen the issue you are having before and can coach you through how to handle it or will dig into the problem with you to find a solution. The people are really the best part of Vault.
     </p>
     <p>
      What is the best part of this job? You will never be bored here. You will continuously be challenged with new issues at clients, new systems and software, new client relationships.
     </p>
     <p>
      We want you to be part of the family! Besides the 5 weeks of PTO, half-day Fridays in the summer, and great health benefits, we want you to join us for our family picnic, Community Day and our yearly Company Retreat.
