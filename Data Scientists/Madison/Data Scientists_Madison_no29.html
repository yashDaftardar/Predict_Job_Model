       AVP is looking for talented, diverse, energetic, and creative folks to join our fantastic team of consultants.

      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       At AVP, we partner with amazing organizations to help maximize the value of their data and information assets. We untangle complex data management challenges and enable organizations to protect, manage, and leverage their assets through our consulting services, software products, and custom software development services. We holistically straddle human, business, and technology aspects of each challenge, apply proven and rigorous approaches, and collaboratively partner with customers to innovate and overcome. We love solving big, complex, difficult problems that have a huge positive impact on people and organizations. Take a look at our portfolio and you’ll see what we mean. Recent and upcoming projects include building experimental machine learning and crowdsourcing workflows for Library of Congress Labs Humans in the Loop , aggregating public datasets and creating a data access portal for Save the Black Press with Black Voice News, History Pin with Shift Collective, and researching researching open A/V streaming media and annotation protocols AudiAnnotate Audiovisual Extensible Workflow (AWE) project with University of Texas.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       We are deeply committed to creating a more equitable and inclusive world. We pursue our values through our work, ensuring that accurate and authentic data is available and used to create breakthrough solutions and solve knotty problems. We also stand firmly committed against systemic racism and all other forms of oppression; and hold ourselves accountable for taking actions that reflect our values. With these values firmly in place, we invite potential team members who share our commitments and reflect a diverse array of lived perspectives and experiences.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       We are seeking a data management consultant who can help bridge our consulting and software development services and products. This role will work on a diverse set of projects and challenges, including data migrations, system integrations, web and desktop application development, and data warehousing development. The one thing that is common to all of them: a lot of data.

       We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. In early 2021, most people are used to working remotely, but we’ve been doing it for years, and will continue to once the world opens back up. We do have offices in Brooklyn, and Madison, WI—if you live in one of those areas, our crews there would love to have you. The rest of us are scattered around.

       We want you to take vacation. It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation on Slack and hearing about your adventures at the weekly standup after you return. Even if you just need a break to sit on the couch for a week (we all know this feeling these days).

       We get the whole team together two times a year to catch up, hang out, and plan for the future. In normal times, we’ll go to places like the mountains of Wyoming, the coastline of Florida (in the winter), and the cheese curds of Madison (at all times of year). We take advantage of working together, have strategy and planning sessions, bring in guest speakers and coaches, and do really fun things. The highlight is always hanging out together and having a blast.

        How to Apply
       </b>
      </h1>
      <p>
       If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don't have a resume because you aren't even sure you're looking to change jobs, that's fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we're looking for. A LinkedIn profile would work too.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
       Attach a PDF of your cover letter. In your cover letter:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and you would be a great fit. Optionally, please include links to relevant past work and anything else that makes you look good, and describe your role in that work.
       </li>
       <li>
        Include answers to the following question: What are two of the most challenging obstacles you have faced when working with large datasets? And how did you overcome them?
        <br/>

       <b>
        Exploratory Interview
       </b>
      </h2>
      <p>
       This is a short, high level conversation seeking to find out more about you, your interests, goals and objectives, background. Also to tell you about AVP, our culture, goals and objectives, services and products, and answer any questions you have.
       <br/>
      </p>

      <h2 class="jobSectionHeader">
       <b>
        In-Depth Interview
       </b>
      </h2>
      <p>
       If the exploratory call goes well, one or two AVPeeps will meet with you, focusing in on a chronological walk-through of each job you have held focusing in on five core questions: What were you hired to do? What accomplishments are you most proud of? What were some of the low points during that job? Who were the people you worked with? Why did you leave that job? At the end of the interview we will discuss your career goals and aspirations, and you will have a chance to ask us questions.

       <b>
        Reference Interviews
       </b>
      </h2>
      <p>
       If the in-depth interview goes well, we will ask you to introduce us to 3 references, representing previous supervisors, people that you supervised, and peer colleagues that you have worked with (as applicable).
       <br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2 class="jobSectionHeader">

        All-Team Interview
