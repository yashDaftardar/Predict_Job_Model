       Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Engineer Co-op Opportunities - June-December 2021
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Wayfair is seeking analytical and action oriented candidates for the Data Science and Machine Learning Engineer Co-op opportunities starting in June 2021. The Data Science and Machine learning team builds the algorithmic systems that drive our business. With 8 expansive workstreams (Pricing, Personalization &amp; Recommendations, Merchandising, Marketing, Measurement, B2B, Computer Vision, and Operations), and more than 20 specialized subteams, the projects that our teams work on directly impact our customers on a massive scale.
     </p>
     <p>
      When applying, please indicate your top choice for team placement, either Data Science or Machine Learning Engineer. If we notice a strong alignment for a team other than those indicated in the application, we will also consider you for that opportunity. Please keep in mind that the Co-op program is a 6 month, full time position.
     </p>

      <b>
       Who We Are | Data Science

     <p>
      We work closely with stakeholders across the business to build scalable ML solutions and algorithmic platforms that drive incremental revenue, enhance customer experience, &amp; improve customer loyalty. The projects that our teams work on are driven from the ground up – we look for entrepreneurial individuals that want to take ownership over their own agenda and thrive in a collaborative team environment. Take for example (1) determining how to implement AR technology to improve the shopping experience versus (2) optimizing diversity in the sales we highlight in a customer’s email. Data is at the heart of everything we do and there is very little at Wayfair that our Data Science team does not touch.
