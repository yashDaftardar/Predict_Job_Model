      <p>
       The George A. Smathers Libraries seek a creative, collaborative, and services-oriented candidate to enhance research support in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Digital Sciences. As part of UF’s partnership with Nvidia and the university’s AI Initiative (https://ai.jobs.ufl.edu/), this position leads the Smathers Libraries’ commitment to “AI for everyone”. The NLP Specialist (AI) is a year-round (12 month) tenure-track faculty position with primary responsibilities in instruction, consultation, and project work in NLP, text mining, predictive text, and related areas. The position works with library colleagues, researchers, and educators from throughout the University of Florida community to create, identify, and evaluate learning resources in the areas of NLP and Digital Sciences; advocate for the role of the Smathers Libraries in supporting related education and research; and build effective, inclusive, collaborations across the campus community.

ARCS is strategically expanding its support to AI education, research, equity, and outreach, with this position formally liaising to other expert faculty hired through the university’s AI Initiative. The NLP Specialist sets a foundation in NLP for UF students from all majors, and faculty and staff interested in incorporating NLP technology and techniques to their discipline-specific teaching and research.

The state's oldest and most comprehensive university, UF is among the nation's most academically diverse public universities and won the 2018 Senator Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization. UF is currently sixth among “Top Public Universities” in the U.S. News and World Report and second among Forbes “Best Value Public Colleges (2016). UF has a long history of established programs in international education, research and service. It is one of only 17 public, land-grant universities that belong to the Association of American Universities. At UF we have some of the top faculty in the country. In addition to attracting over $900 million in research each year, they foster the uniquely collaborative environment that transforms potential into actual results. UF traces its beginnings to a small seminary in 1853 and is now one of the largest universities in the nation, with more than 50,000 students. The University of Florida seeks to address key challenges of our time, from COVID-19 to racism. For more information, please consult the UF homepage.

       The University of Florida is building an AI program with both breadth and depth: The depth to produce top Ph.D.’s in AI technology and the breadth to infuse AI into UF’s entire curriculum so that all students, graduate and undergraduate, regardless of their major, develop basic awareness and competence in how AI is transforming their future careers. This will equip every University of Florida student to help Florida build a tech-driven, high-wage economy in fields as diverse as medicine, agriculture, defense, manufacturing, software development, education, business, and more. The impact will be far reaching—the University of Florida student equipped with this knowledge will work independently with AI and data science to create new markets, new technologies, and an increasingly inclusive, ethical and just future. The University of Florida has committed to hiring 100 AI-focused faculty across the entire university. These faculty are being sought as members of interdisciplinary teams that span multiple colleges, where UF will leverage its existing expertise as well as new faculty to tackle some of society’s most pressing challenges.
