    We are Cognizant Artificial Intelligence
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AI and analytics give companies a once-in-a-generation opportunity to perform orders of magnitude better than ever before. In order to do so, our clients need new business models built from analyzing dynamically changing customer and business operations data to drive ideal business decisions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chances are you're not looking for business as usual. Neither are we. Find out more about our student and entry level opportunities. Cognizant’s AI and Analytics (AIA) Practice has a challenging Data Scientist role.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    A New Generation of Cognizant
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cognizant’s Generation Cognizant or “Gen C” program is internally recognized as the future of Cognizant and includes associates that are hired into the company through our campus recruitment channels. This program is designed to be the perfect bridge between academia and the corporate world allowing associates to Start Smart and Think Big. Check out these videos to hear from Current Gen C’ers on what the associate experience is like within Cognizant.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Leadership Commitment
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cognizant leadership has strategically devoted a lot of attention to our Gen C program and fully recognizes these associates as the future of Cognizant. This stems from the investment dollars spent on developing our talent. Gen C AIA associates are introduced to the company culture immediately via a weeklong training program headed by Cognizant Academy. They are then provided around two months of role specific technical training to ensure a successful client placement. At the end of each training cycle, associates attend our Cognizant Graduation Ceremony where they get to interact with some of AIA’s most senior leaders.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    AIA Studio Collaboration Center
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In order to support our Gen C studio center delivery model, a collaboration hub has been established in Plano, Texas. This collaboration hub or “solution center” acts as the main office for all things Gen C. Associates typically work remotely for their clients from this office. (Note: There are certain cases in which clients request their associates be located onsite therefore this role is considered to be Nationwide). The office is designed to be as collaborative as possible with wide open seating and many white boarding rooms. Associates note that there is always a quiet hum due to the number of innovative conversations going on.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Career Launchpad
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With so much innovation and creativity happening in one place, there is bound to be someone that has faced a similar challenge within the building. Instead of spending countless hours furiously trying to understand why your code will not compile, rely on your colleagues as a resource to overcome barriers. Associates are also paired with a mentor within the first month of joining Cognizant. These mentors act as a safety net for the associate to ask questions and seek advice. Mentor relationships are cultivated using our Chronus mentoring tool, ensuring associates get the most out of their relationships.
