    Cisco Webex is the World's #1 business collaboration and customer engagement platform. It is used across all industries in the world and is being used to support governments, business, education, and more including use by 85% of Fortune 500 business. Cisco is the clear market leader in cognitive collaboration for unified communication and contact centers with People Insights, Webex Assistant, Webex Experience Management and now Babblelabs noise cancelation. These technologies are being integrated into Webex calling, meetings, messaging, team collaboration and contact center.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The workplace of the future will be powered by AI and the Cisco Webex Intelligence team is making that a reality. The Intelligence team is comprised of three fast-moving startups that were recently acquired by Cisco to boost the industry's #1 Collaboration portfolio. We aim to build the next generation of collaboration software, devices, and APIs - from digitizing the in-meeting experience, enhancing distributed team efficiency and improving all aspects of people connection.
    <br/>
    What You’ll Do
    <br/>
    In this role, you'll work on the Webex Graph and People Insights features. We’ve built a proprietary data platform that scours billions of pages on the web and uses intelligence and machine learning to create the richest, most real-time profiles in the world for hundreds of millions of people and tens of millions of companies.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To do this we tackle problems like - How do you decide which parts of the web to crawl? How do you extract structured data from unstructured text? How do you efficiently keep this data up to date?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We’re now working to combine this rich person and company data with real-time information about people's interactions, to unify all the Collaboration data across our Collaboration portfolio into a networked graph of all your interactions and relationships. It’s an enormous and exciting massive-scale data problem with a huge amount of whitespace problems to tackle from scratch as part of that effort. How do you store and query all this data efficiently? What unique deductions and insights might you make from it? It’s also one which we feel has huge product implications for being able to help improve people’s lives at massive scale during this time of almost entirely remote work.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Webex Graph seeks to provide our customers with perfect context on the people they are meeting and collaborating with, right when they need it. We seek to provide users with all the context the need to succeed... Who are you meeting with? What are the most important facts about the company they work for? Do you have anything in common with them?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Our team is ripe with exciting technical challenges, most of which have yet to be solved here and some of which have yet to be solved anywhere!
    <br/>
    Who You’ll Work With
    <br/>
    You’ll join a small, high-caliber team of machine learning specialists, large scale systems experts, natural language processing experts, product gurus, customer champions, and world-class designers who are passionate about the future brought by AI. We move fast, continuously improve, and deliver high-impact results. We’re not only aiming to build AI applications; we strive to build the best applications of AI the world has ever seen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We have a team of world-class product managers, designers, and engineers who are exceptionally talented and all low ego. Many of our engineers have founded their own startups prior to forming Webex Intelligence, and they bring a wide and diverse set of industry experience and expertise with them. We draw on this well of experiences every day as we collaborate on our own product, tech stack, and go to market strategy. We have a strong “eat our own dogfood” culture. We live and breathe Webex everyday because we use the platform every day. We're highly collaborative, committed to building great things, and consider it a privilege to learn from each other every day.
    <br/>
    Who You Are
    <br/>
    You take pride in building and shipping fabulous software. You thrive on ownership and autonomy, but are also committed to collaborating and communicating across the team's different stakeholders and domain experts. You enjoy working in an interdisciplinary environment that requires interfacing cross-functionally, from product to sales to customer support. You hold yourself and your teammates to a very high degree of quality in everything you do. You're hungry to apply the skills you already have, and to learn new ones from the work you'll do and team you'll work with. You thrive on constructive feedback and you deliver results that matter.
    <br/>
    Requirements
    <br/>
    6+ Years of experience writing robust systems that have served real customers
    <br/>
    Solid foundation in Computer Science (algorithms, data structures, software design)
    <br/>
    Great can-do attitude and ability to thrive and learn in a fast-paced environment
    <br/>
    Strong written and verbal communication abilities and a commitment to using them
    <br/>
    Desire to work on a highly scalable and available system used by tens of millions of users daily
    <br/>
    Most of our codebase is in Ruby and C++, but languages can be learned. We prioritize general programming ability over any specific language experience.
    <br/>
    Experience being a generalist—curiosity about and ability to work on different parts of the system (backend, front-end, mobile, data mining, machine learning) We Are Cisco
    <br/>
    #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
