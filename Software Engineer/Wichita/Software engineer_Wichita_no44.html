       The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      You have a creative mind, attention to detail, and a genuine passion for the craft of software engineering. You love solving problems, learning new technologies, and making data-centric software scale massively.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Tanzu Observability by Wavefront offers many opportunities for applying your creativity and skills to a cutting-edge cloud observability platform that sets the industry standard in scalability and usability. We are a growing team developing a SaaS product that is used 24/7 by development and site-reliability teams at leading enterprises such as Lyft, Doordash, Reddit, Snowflake, Intuit, Box, Workday, and many more!

       What is the primary need, technical challenge, and/or problem you will be responsible for?
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      We need a staff engineer who can lead the delivery of the Tanzu Observability backend. You will be working on high-performance data ingestion and querying of metrics, histograms, events and other data, along with enabling intuitive experiences in the management and organization of dashboarding, alerting, and other observability workflows through backend APIs and processes. Your work may even connect users with AI-assisted suggestion and remediation for when customer infrastructure issues are detected. Additionally, you will provide coding (Java), performance, and architectural guidance, mentorship, and reviews to a team of very strong backend engineers.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      You will be working closely with other software architects, mentoring other engineers, product managers, and the release and SRE teams as you design and implement these novel features deliver customer value as a member of the Metrics observability subgroup under Tanzu Observability.
     </p>
     <p>
      <br/>
      You may create new query functions built on our streaming query engine, then move on to creating novel ways to do AI-aided alerting, help us reach new highs in data ingestion rate by using our No-SQL key-value store more efficiently, or shorten our release cycles by creating more granular logical micro-services.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      What differentiates Tanzu Observability in the current observability landscape is our scalable and extremely powerful data platform and UI, and you will play a key role in taking our platform to the next level.
