       Your Team responsibilities
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      MSCI has an opening for an ED level Developer and Architect reporting into the Head of Analytics Engineering. You will be a hands-on architect/developer supporting our Investment Analytics product line, a $500M+ business. The systems which you will work on will be amongst the most mission critical of MSCI. They require a strong technology expertise and a strong sense of enterprise system design, state of the art scalability, reliability, and innovation in emerging cloud technologies and data science. The system will need to be accessible to both developers (through a REST based “aaS” offering) as well as end-users through our web-based portal; the ideal candidate will be able to help with both, diving deep into anything / everything.
     </p>
     <p>
      MSCI is undergoing a massive engineering transformation, with the recent announcement of our Investment Solutions as a Service offering. This announcement is the cultivation of many different efforts, all of which require engineers who can be tactical and strategic when looking at our architecture and critical engineering initiatives (e.g. migration into the cloud, new React based web experiences, REST APIs). This leader must be a change agent, who is able and deeply dive in and identify what needs to be changed, how it should be changed, and then drive that change across your team, your peers, and the company.
     </p>
     <p>
      The opening is for a super star, a developer who can span back end architecture to front end experiences. The developer will need to have a strong development background and be able to look holistically across the system, and jump in where needed by writing code, debugging, or driving architectural sessions.
