As part of GAGE, UNAVCO operates a large network of geodetic instruments (primarily GNSS) and a world class data facility and archive. This facility supports a broad range of applications from the study of plate tectonics and earthquakes to real-time precise vehicle navigation and fiducial networks.

      For over three decades, UNAVCO has spearheaded the utilization of cutting-edge technologies in geodesy while providing robust operational support for researchers exploring the solid Earth (earthquakes, volcanoes, plate tectonics), the hydrosphere (deformation of ice, the Earth's response to groundwater, sea level change), and the atmosphere. Our instrumentation toolbox includes high-precision GPS/GNSS, lidar and optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), borehole geophysics, and more.
