      Everything we do at Buildout starts and ends with our people, and our customers and our product is an important part of our community of people.
     </p>
     <p>
      In our company, we value Team, Customers, Product, Improvement, and Profit. When we say we value the Product, it means that we commit to creating an exceptional product and experience for our customers. Our software team works closely with our Product team to build and improve our industry-leading commercial real estate platform. You must be willing to painstakingly perfect every detail while maintaining the full picture and guiding everybody you work with toward delivering on the vision. Our efforts speak for themselves - we are one of the few SaaS companies that have negative net churn and we've been listed in Inc. 5000 four years in a row.
     </p>
     <p>
      We use a variety of technologies, including Ruby, JavaScript, React, and ES6 to create a marketing suite, which gathers Buildout users' property information into a central Rails application, and then sends it out to our users' customers through all the main marketing channels. We create emails, pdf documents, print materials, almost anything you can think of. We also have a modern, customizable plugin that brokers can embed in their websites to keep every bit of information up to date.
     </p>
     <p>
      We're building a diverse and collaborative team that gets results sustainably. Your contributions will have a direct impact on the growth of the department and the company and you can bring your passion for great products to the table every day.
     </p>
     <h2 class="jobSectionHeader">
      What You'll Bring to Buildout
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       3+ years of software development experience or the ability to demonstrate you've learned enough in less time to still be a great engineer and valuable team member
      </li>
      <li>
       Solid cross-team and cross-functional communication skills
      </li>
      <li>
       A love of software engineering, design, documentation, testing, and automation
      </li>
      <li>
       Pluses, but not required:
      </li>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Commercial Real Estate experience
       </li>
       <li>
        Cool personal projects you'd like to share and chat about
       </li>

        What are the technical skills that you'll need to succeed?
       </i>
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      We are looking for a full-stack engineer. However, "full-stack" can mean a lot these days, so here is what we're looking for specifically:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Ruby/Rails:
      </b>
      We're a Ruby shop here at Buildout, so a deep knowledge of Rails is going to help you get up and running quickly. Our app uses all of the standard Rails goodness you know and love, as well as a lot of additional tools for design, business logic, and background jobs. If you like to learn new skills, you're going to fit in really well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Javascript:
      </b>
      Our front-end relies heavily on Javascript. We currently have a mix of core features written using vanilla ES5 and React, but are focusing on ES6 and React for all future front-end work. We are looking for people with a strong working Javascript base who want to keep finding and working with the best new tools.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Testing:
      </b>
      Is testing a natural part of your process? If so, you'll be appreciated here. We are actively building out our test suite and providing ample team resources to make sure that everything we create is tested and rock-solid. Our test suite uses RSpec for most of our Rails work.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Other Web Tech:
      </b>
      We use git for source control, Slim for our view templates, lightly customized Bootstrap for our CSS, MySQL and AWS. If you're really passionate about some new technology, we'd love to hear about it.
     </p>
     <h2 class="jobSectionHeader">
      What You'll Do at Buildout
     </h2>

        Due to the unprecedented situation of COVID-19, Buildout has decided to protect our current and future employees by managing our business remotely. This is inclusive of interviewing, onboarding and each role day-to-day.
