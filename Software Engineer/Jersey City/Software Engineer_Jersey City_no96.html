In this role, you’ll utilize your perspective and experience in UI/UX, design systems, and modern front-end technologies to help our design and product teams envision the best solutions for our business and readers.

      Wirecutter is powered by a modern web stack consisting of a variety of languages and frameworks. On the front end we rely on: SCSS, React, NextJS, Storybook.js, Node.js, Apollo GraphQL, and on the backend: WordPress and Laravel PHP.

     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Wirecutter helps people buy the right things for the way they want to live. The site was founded by journalists in September 2011 and was acquired by The New York Times Company in October 2016. Our recommendations are made through vigorous reporting, interviewing, and testing by teams of veteran journalists, scientists, and researchers. Consider us a best-of list for everyday things; a curated gallery filled with only interesting, useful objects; a thank-you note to the designers and engineers who create the stuff that makes our lives better; a geeky friend with next-level research skills who tests everything they buy so you don’t have to. The point is to make buying great gear quickly easier so you can get on with living your life.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      We pride ourselves on following rigorous journalistic standards and ethics, and we maintain editorial independence from our business operations. Our recommendations are always made entirely by our editorial team without input from our revenue team, and our writers and editors are never made aware of any business relationships. Wirecutter is mission driven and reader supported; learn more about us here .

     <p>
      Our principles help us create a work environment that breeds trust, respect, learning and is one that we all are excited about showing up to each day.

      <b>
       Seek Understanding:
      </b>
      We are lifelong students who want to understand the world around us. We are curious to understand our readers, how we get better at our own disciplines and how we can work better together. This means we are active listeners, information hunters and empathetic.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Explain Why:
      </b>
      Because we seek to understand, we value the importance of explaining our ideas and our understanding. This means we are constructively candid, sharing our perspectives and the thought process behind it. And then learning from the conversation that ensues. We are all teachers and students, helping each other grow.

       Solve Things:

      We love to solve things, whether they are our own problems, our readers problems or our colleagues problems. While we often can solve problems on our own, we believe our best results come out when we solve them together.

     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Get It Done:
      </b>
      We are passionate about getting things done. Whether it is our own individual work or teamwork, our instinct is to forge a path forward and learn as we go. This means we continually focus on how to turn work into achievable chunks, communicate those effectively to the team and efficiently execute against them.

       Make It Better:

      We aren’t satisfied with perpetuating the status quo. We’re always looking forward. We live to change the world around us for the better, making a difference in our own lives and our readers’ lives. If we are being ambitious enough, this means that we will both fail and succeed and we take pride in owning both of those outcomes as long as we are learning.
