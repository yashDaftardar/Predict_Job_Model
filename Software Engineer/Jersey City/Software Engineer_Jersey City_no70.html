            THE AGENCY
            <br/>
            The Department of City Planning (DCP) plans for the strategic growth and development of the City through ground-up planning with communities, the development of land use policies and zoning regulations applicable citywide and sharing its perspectives on growth and community needs with sister agencies in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            DCP’s six strategic objectives include: (a) catalyze long-term neighborhood improvement through integrated planning and targeted accompanying public investments; (b) encourage housing production, affordability, and quality; (c) promote economic development and job growth; (d) enhance resiliency and sustainability of neighborhoods; (e) ensure integrity, timeliness and responsiveness in land use reviews; and, (f) supply objective data and expertise to a broad range of planning functions and stakeholders.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Central to its mission, DCP supports the City Planning Commission in its annual review of approximately 450 land use applications. The Department also works closely with OMB in developing the Ten-Year Capital Strategy, and helping administer the Neighborhood Development Fund, geared toward ensuring that growing neighborhoods undergoing rezoning have accompanying infrastructure investments.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            THE DIVISION
            <br/>
            Information Technology Division (ITD) is responsible for supporting the agency’s technology footprint including technology infrastructure across five boroughs, as well as workflow applications and databases for analytics and decision making. The division is comprised of 50+ inter-disciplinary staff with specialties in desktop support, server engineering, telecom, application development, data processing, data visualization and mapping amongst many others. The technology ecosystem in the agency has become increasing hybrid especially with deployment options (cloud vs. on premise), multiple technology stacks (commercial vs. open source) and project management (waterfall vs. agile).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Citywide Geographic Application Services is responsible for the maintenance and continued enhancement of the Geosupport System, an integrated system of software and data files that processes geographic locations in New York City. Geosupport is a critical application which is highly customized for New York City’s geography. Currently, Geosupport is used as a component of computer applications in more than forty New York City agencies. Geosupport can be readily incorporated into users’ applications which require the processing of geographic data. Citywide Geographic Application Services is staffed by a team of software engineers specializing in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a growing variety of technology stacks including cloud computing as we modernize our system off the mainframe. The team also supports Linux, GeoX, .net and Java environments.
