         Position Overview:
        </b>
       </h3>
       <p>
        Savance is looking for a talented and experienced developer in search of a long term career with a growing, innovative company. Are you a problem solver? Do you love computers? Have you taught yourself a computer language for fun, or designed something just for the challenge? Has your significant other had to remind you what time it is because you’re still up at 3am coding? Have you brought your laptop with you on vacation? Do you code for fun? If the answer to several – or all – of the above is yes, you may be the person we’re looking for. Unlock your potential at a fun and innovative small business where you can turn ideas into reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        First and foremost, we are looking for someone who is addicted to computers and drawn to software development and engineering. We would like to find someone that prides himself/herself on being an overachiever. The candidate should also possess strong problem-solving skills. We need someone who is able to grasp the big picture of a project, yet be able to break it down into smaller parts to accomplish the task. It is extremely critical that the candidate can accomplish a lot within a short timeframe. The right person must also have the ability to work independently – with little or no supervision – communicate effectively, design with limited details, architect the best solution with his or her team, code it, test it, and provide a solid deliverable without being micro-managed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Senior Software Engineer will manage a variety of projects within our Savance Workplace product line, which is primarily used for visitor management, health screening, emergency accountability, and staff tracking. The role will be responsible for gathering requirements, working with team members and key customers to ensure their design will meet certain requirements, then implementing the design within an aggressive timeline typically set during the design phase. The right person should also have experience in the entire development cycle (design, develop, test, and release – cradle to grave) of critical business software. This includes, but is not limited to, defining requirements, researching methods to accomplish tasks, breaking down the project into smaller parts and creating a timeline, coordinating resources to help accomplish the goal, and then ultimately delivering on or before established deadlines. This position will also be responsible for establishing quality standards (i.e. automated testing) as well as suggesting and establishing new processes and procedures to streamline the overall development and testing process.
       </p>

         The Ideal Candidate
        </b>
       </h3>
       <p>
        When it comes to the ideal candidate, we envision someone that has a lot of cloud enterprise development experience, ideally with Azure. It might be experience that you gained as a consultant, through training or self-teachings, or while working for a larger enterprise organization. Maybe you are tired of the large enterprise red tape and feel like it’s hard to make an impact, or maybe COVID-19 has changed your situation and has you looking around for a different opportunity. If you want to bring your experience and expertise to a smaller team where you can make a difference and see major impacts from your contributions, this is the role for you.
