       THE TEAM
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Integration Team is part of a development organization that supports the Ticketmaster Archtics platform.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARCHTICS is the primary tool used by the NFL, NHL, NBA, and major event venues globally. It supports CRM/retention, marketing, renewals, invoice/payment processing, inventory control, and reporting, seeing more than $3.8B in transactions annually.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      The primary focus of the Integration Team is to support Ticketmaster clients (major sports teams and venues) as well as “Nexus” vendor partnerships by enhancing our B2B offerings, adding best-of-breed solution providers to Ticketmaster's product portfolio. This includes providing access to data through APIs, file-based delivery, and streaming as well as miscellaneous asks that other teams cannot fill.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       THE JOB
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Aid in the design, development and implementation of software code while participating in team activities and contributing to discussions. As a developer on a growing team of 8, work collaboratively with the team to drive towards more modern technologies. Ticketmaster is at an exciting point in the company’s history- we are still rapidly growing while simultaneously undergoing major initiatives to modernize key platforms. Archtics is one of the key, core platforms in the Ticketmaster tech stack.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Engineers on our team are looking to provide new, more efficient ways to deliver data to our clients and partners. Most of our current technology is based on nightly file-based deliveries or API calls to/from client databases. Current reporting capabilities within Archtics, while broad in scope, are not as flexible as needed. To add stability to client systems and provide data in near-real time, more flexible solutions using data streaming technologies, off-platform data storage in AWS, and other approaches are being pursued. New, more customizable and flexible reporting tools that integrate into the existing Ticketmaster reporting portals are also being pursued and developed. Getting data to clients and customers faster and offering greater flexibility is our goal. Utilizing new, versatile and widely used technologies are the means of getting us there. Developers are offered wide flexibility in choosing these tools and products.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Working closely with major sports teams and venues, our developers get the satisfaction of directly seeing the impact of the work they do- helping to get millions of fans into live events every day- they do this while getting the chance to investigate and implement cutting edge technologies.
